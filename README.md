# **LungAI - Breathe Smart, Live Better**

## **Overview**
LungAI is a real-time air quality monitoring wearable designed to protect individuals, especially vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD, from harmful air pollution. With advanced sensors, LungAI continuously tracks **PM2.5, PM1, and PM10** levels, providing instant feedback and personalized health recommendations.

## **Why LungAI?**
### **The Problem**
- **Air pollution is a silent killer.** It affects millions of people globally, with fine particulate matter (PM) deeply penetrating the lungs and causing severe health issues.
- **COPD is a leading cause of death.** In the U.S., over **14 million adults** suffer from COPD, with many more undiagnosed.
- **Global impact:** COPD caused **3.5 million deaths in 2021**, accounting for **5% of total deaths worldwide** ([WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-%28copd%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
- **PM2.5 pollution alone was responsible for 4.14 million deaths worldwide in 2019** ([State of Global Air](https://www.stateofglobalair.org/health/pm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### **Who is at Risk?**
- **Children:** Developing lungs are highly vulnerable to PM exposure, leading to long-term health effects.
- **Elderly:** Higher susceptibility to respiratory diseases and cardiovascular complications.
- **Asthma & COPD Patients:** Even minor exposure to pollutants can trigger severe health episodes.
- **Urban Dwellers & Commuters:** Daily exposure to traffic and industrial pollution increases health risks over time.

## **Key Features**
### **1. Real-time Air Quality Monitoring**
- Tracks **PM2.5, PM1, and PM10** levels with high accuracy.
- Measures AQI (Air Quality Index) and provides instant alerts when pollution levels become harmful.

### **2. AI-Powered Health Insights**
- AI-driven predictive analysis detects trends in exposure and personal health impact.
- Custom recommendations to avoid high-risk areas and times.

### **3. Wearable & Portable Design**
- Compact and lightweight for everyday use.
- Seamlessly integrates with mobile and desktop applications for continuous tracking.

### **4. Personalized Alerts & Recommendations**
- Real-time notifications when air quality worsens.
- Adaptive suggestions based on individual respiratory health conditions.

### **5. Long Battery Life & Connectivity**
- **Battery:** Up to **48 hours** on a single charge.
- **Connectivity:** Bluetooth & Wi-Fi enabled for continuous updates.
